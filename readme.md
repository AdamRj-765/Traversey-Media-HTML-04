# Traversy Media's YouTube: Build An HTML5 Website With A Responsive Layout




I have re-created the site files for Traversy Media's popular YouTube video "Build An HTML5 Website With A Responsive Layout" for anyone to use in place of the no longer functioning download links in the video description labeled:

CODE DOWNLOAD:
https://www.traversymedia.com/download/...

I actually found the URL for the download as being this that DOES work:

http://www.traversymedia.com/downloads/acme_website.zip

That link does not work from YouTube but will work if you use the link above as it will download a zip file with the original site files provided by Traversy Media


The video is located here and is still viewable:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm6CUkswsNw&t=8s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia


The description of the video is thus:
In this video we will build a clean coded responsive mobile friendly HTML5 website for a fictional web design company. We will go over semantic HTML tags like header and footer as well as the basics of HTML and CSS. This is a great project for beginners.

Omni-Solutions Tech wishes to thank Traversy Media for thier source code and wonderful tutorial. We recommend this video to any of our staff who wish to move into our development department and who may have little to no HTML5 coding experience and we believe this is a good place for beginner web developers.

We have also added stepped index.html files that are numbered in the following manor:

index-0005-0005-0005.html -is the first few steps of code added to the index file.
index-0005-0005-0010.html -is the second index file with a few more lines of code added.
etc.

The same goes for the css files.  They are linked to the index file numbering system as well, therefore:

style-0005-0005-0025.css has code that was added at the time that index-0005-0005-0025.html file had it's code added.
etc.

This way the audience can see the progression of the code in steps if they wish to do so. For any of the files, the regularly named index.html and style.css are the most developed and ready to be served as site files.

We have also mapped out visually the file system schema for the site files as seen below:
